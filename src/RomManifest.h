// src/RomManifest.h
//
// What Bootcade did to the files it manages, written down next to them.
//
// The outbox and the quarantine are plain folders, and a folder cannot say
// why a file is in it: what set it belongs to, where it came from, whether it
// was rebuilt from three sources or merely renamed, when it arrived. Until
// now that was known only for the session that did it and lost on exit. So
// each managed folder carries a `.bootcade-manifest.json` at its root, one
// entry per file Bootcade put there, and a bounded history of the entries
// that have since left it and how (moved into the library, restored, deleted).
//
// The manifest is a record, never an authority: the files on disk are what
// exists. A file with no entry is simply one Bootcade did not put there (a
// manual drop) and is shown as such; an entry whose file is gone is retired
// to the history on the next reconcile.
