// src/RomResolve.h
//
// The one place that decides whether a set is available, incorrect or missing.
//
// Three code paths used to carry their own copy of that rule : the live scan
// (one zip at a time, in parallel), the cache re-match after a DAT update, and
// the library audit. They agreed only as long as the rule stayed "every ROM the
// DAT lists must be in the set's own zip", which is the *non-merged* layout and
// nothing else. FBNeo DATs mark 85 % of Neo Geo ROMs and 56 % of arcade ROMs
// with merge= : in a *split* collection those live in the parent's zip (or the
// BIOS's), and a set that lacks them is complete, not broken.
//
// So the rule now takes the collection's style and, for inherited ROMs, a way
// to look at other archives. Callers plug in where those archives come from
// (a freshly read zip, the zip_contents cache, the audit's index); the rule
// itself never touches the disk or the database.
